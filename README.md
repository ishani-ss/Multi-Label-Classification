# Multi-Label-Classification
This repository captures experimentation with the scikit-multilearn package and its uses in multi-label classification.

To navigate this repository, the following files are available for exploration:
1. [**101-data-exploratiion.ipynb**:](https://github.com/ishani-ss/Multi-Label-Classification/blob/main/101_data_exploration.ipynb) This code explores the dataset [PubMed Multi Label Text Classification Dataset.csv].
2. [**102_data_preprocessing.ipynb**:](https://github.com/ishani-ss/Multi-Label-Classification/blob/main/102_data_preprocessing.ipynb) The code can be run from this Jupyter Notebook down, with preprocessing conducted to prepare the data.
3. **103_data_vectorisation.ipynb**: This code takes the preprocessed data and vectorises text data for model preparation.
4. **104_data_modelling.ipynb**: This code conducts the modelling stage of the project, with performance metrics output from the testing dataset.

Some further files for consideration are:
- [**modelling_notes_and_caveats.md**:](https://github.com/ishani-ss/Multi-Label-Classification/blob/main/modelling_notes_and_caveats.md) This notebook covers the modelling features and caveats encountered in this project.
- [**data**:](https://github.com/ishani-ss/Multi-Label-Classification/tree/main/data) The data folder includes the raw data [PubMed Multi Label Text Classification Dataset.csv], the features and labels and the vectorised data used for modelling.
